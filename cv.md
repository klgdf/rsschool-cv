Learned from videos by [Vladilen Minin](https://www.youtube.com/c/VladilenMinin) and [Freelancer for Life](https://www.youtube.com/c/FreelancerLifeStyle), also read learnjavascript and MDN. There has been constant practice since the beginning of learning. A little less than a month later I took my first commercial order - website layout for a Czech medical center.
